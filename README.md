**EmoTa** is the first emotional speech dataset in Tamil, designed to reflect the linguistic diversity of Sri Lankan Tamil speakers. It includes 936 utterances from 22 native Tamil speakers (11 male, 11 female), each articulating 19 semantically neutral sentences across five primary emotions: **Anger**, **Happiness**, **Sadness**, **Fear**, and **Neutrality**.

## Key Features:
- **Speakers**: 22 native Tamil speakers (11 male, 11 female)
- **Emotions**: Anger, Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Neutrality
- **Sentences**: 19 semantically neutral sentences to reduce lexical bias
- **Recording Quality**: Captured in a controlled, soundproof environment with professional equipment
- **Total Duration**: Approx. 48 minutes of speech

## Dataset Structure:
The dataset is organized into emotion-based folders with the following naming convention:

```
EmoTa/
    ├── happy/
    ├── sad/
    ├── angry/
    ├── fear/
    └── neutral/
        └── <spkID>_<senID>_<emo[:3]>.wav
```

## Purpose:
EmoTa aims to facilitate research in **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** for the Tamil language, offering a balanced and diverse representation of emotional expressions from native Tamil speakers. It is released as open-access to support further exploration of Tamil language processing.
