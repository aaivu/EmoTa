## Key Features:

- **Emotions**: Anger, Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Neutrality
- **Sentences**: 19 semantically neutral sentences to reduce lexical bias

## Dataset Structure:
The dataset is organized into emotion-based folders with the following naming convention:

    ├── sad/
    ├── angry/
    ├── fear/
    └── neutral/
        └── <spkID>_<senID>_<emo[:3]>.wav
